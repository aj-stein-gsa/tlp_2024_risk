# What's threat modeling?
- Let's list and diagram:
    - assets;
    - threats;
    - mitigations;
    - and most importantly, gaps!
- What about the real world? Does it scale?

    - Multiple parties + systems of systems ‚Üí grokking the attack surface of the whole Internet!?

# But what about ...

‚ùå Generative AI?
‚ùå Secure multi-party computation?
‚ùå Homomorphic encryption?
‚úÖ TLP?
ü§î Circling back on GenAI, SMPC, and HME, with labelled TLP data?
